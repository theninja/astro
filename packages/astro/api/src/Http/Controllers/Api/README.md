## API Error Codes & Responses

### HTTP Status Code Types

We use standard HTTP status codes in our app. The ones we use can be split into four categories.
Any client logic can easily know the overall status of an HTTP request based on its code.

| Code | Type |
| --- | --- |
| 2xx | Success  |
| 3xx | Redirection  |
| 4xx | Client error  |
| 5xx | Server error  |
